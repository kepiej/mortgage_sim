# mortgage_sim - Mortgage simulator written in Rust.

This is a small project that can simulate mortgage payments. It is written in Rust and provides a command-line interface for users to input their mortgage details and receive a breakdown of their monthly payments.

This is an educational project for me to learn Rust.
